## Informationals at Artsy

#### Setup

We don't do phone screens at Artsy. We strive for informationals with engineers. These are usually a coffee/tea with someone at Artsy who will be there to answer questions about the business and try to understand whether you've likely to succeed at Artsy.

If you're going to start an informational from scratch, you're probably going to want to start the conversation using the greenhouse "Email [name]" button, then choose the "Engineering - Invite to Coffee template". 

If you're going to do it on-site in NYC, ask them to met you at Artsy, and give them a tour. Then take them down to [La Colombe](https://code.dblock.org/2016/08/30/phone-screens-are-harmful-and-the-benefits-of-the-informational-interview.html1) for an hour or so.

Then do some back-and-forth to eventually find a time. Make a calendar event for the two of you.

#### Chat

Your aims as an Artsy representative is to predominantly have a feel for these questions:

- Are they a culture add?
- Could they get through the interview process?
- What's their relationship to the art world?

You want to have a sense of how to [describe Artsy, this talk by dB](https://code.dblock.org/2017/10/10/artsy-overview-for-coalition-for-queens-and-q-and-a.html) should give some ideas on how that works. Almost everything you know about Artsy is pretty safe to talk about, try to avoid future roadmap things outside of this quarter, and definitely avoid raw stats if you're unsure of whether they're public or not. If you want to know what you can say stats-wise, the [talking points are here](https://sites.google.com/a/artsymail.com/intranet/communications/media-one-sheet).

Here's the TL:DR (in mid-2018):

> Artsy is the global platform for collecting and discovering art. Artsy partners with
leading museums, international galleries, auction houses, and art fairs to create
the worldâ€™s largest art marketplace. Artsy expands the entire art market by using
best-in-class technology to effectively connecting supply and demand at a global
scale. With 2,500+ partners across 90+ countries and the most-read art publication
online, Artsy empowers a global audience to learn about, discover, and collect art.
Launched in 2012, Artsy is headquartered in New York City with offices
in London, Berlin, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong.

Try to repeatedly wrap up by asking if someone has more questions, usually mine end up a long string of __"OK, so do you have anymore questions?"__. This ensures someone has had a lot of opportunities to dig in and get everything they want to know.
