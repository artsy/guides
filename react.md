### React Guide

A great file for a React component reads in three parts:

* Styled Components setup
* Interfaces for Component
* The Component itself

## Styled Components

Use Styled Components to rename your primitives to describe their use. E.g. from `Text` to `AvatarText`

```js
const AvatarText = styled.Text`
  font-family: ${Fonts.AvantGardeRegular};
  font-size: 16;
`
```

Use CSS-like formatting for your attributes (instead of React Native's camelCase e.g. `fontFamily`)

## Interfaces

These provide documentation for others on how to use your component.

Use an interface for both your `Props` and `State` - ideally name them as these. If you have shared properties you
can use `extends` on another interface to provide additional attributes.

### State

### Props

The interface for your props is one of the main ways which people will interact with your components, so take extra
time in ensuring it covers all the usage you expect.

If a prop's object is complex use ESDoc to annotate it so other don't need to read the source when working with it.

##### Examples

A prop definition for a view subclass which must contain a title, but could optionally work with either a `href` or
an `onPress` function:

````ts
interface Props extends ViewProperties {
  title: string

  /** URL button should link to, prioritised over onPress */
  href?: string

  /** A callback for when the button it tapped */
  onPress?: () => void
}```


A prop definition which combines a typical `View`s props and props which are generated by `Relay`:

```ts
interface Props extends ViewProperties, RelayProps {}
````

## The Component

### Function over Classes for small components

Aim for stateless, aim for function based components. So if your component looks like:

```js
export class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, null> {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>[...]</View>
    )
  }

  openLink() {
    [...]
  }
}
```

It can be better represented as:

```js
export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  const openLink = () => [...]
  return <View>[...]</View>
}
```

Or, you could move the openLink out and pass in the required params:

```js
const openLink = (url: string) => [...]

export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => <View>[...]</View>
```
